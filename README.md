# **img2map.py**

# What is img2map.py?
 - A simple python script used for converting image textures to maps and converting image file types.
 # What can it do?
 Conversion of images to texture maps:
 
 - Roughness maps
 - Metallic maps
 - Opacity maps
 - Displacement maps
 - Bump maps
 


Conversion of image file types
 1. PNG
 2. JPG
 3. TIF
 4. BMP
# Why use it?
There is no particular reason to use it. It might be very inefficient, I don't know. But it can be useful in several cases:
 1. When you are working offline and don't have access to the internet
 2. When you need mass conversion of files
 3. When you don't trust online converters
# How did you create it?
I used a bit of my own coding knowledge, as well as StackOverFlow to finish this application.
It took some time to finish, and I learned a lot creating it.
