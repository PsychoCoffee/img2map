# **img2map.py**
![](https://github.com/PsychoCoffee/img2map/blob/main/banner.png)
# What is img2map.py?
 - A simple python script used for converting image textures to maps and converting image file types.
 - Please ignore if some of the features don't work as well as they're supposed to, ***this is a deprecated project***.
 # What can it do?
 Conversion of images to texture maps:
 
 - Roughness maps
 - Metallic maps
 - Opacity maps
 - Displacement maps (Adjustable intensity values)
 - Bump maps
 
 (The end results may not be perfect and might be wrong!)
 
Conversion of image file types

 1. PNG
 2. JPG
 3. TIF
 4. BMP
 
# Why use it?
There is no particular reason to use it. It might be very inefficient, I don't know. But it can be useful in several cases:
 1. When you are working offline and don't have access to the internet
 2. When you need mass conversion of files
 3. When you don't trust online converters
# How did you create it?
I used a bit of my own coding knowledge, as well as StackOverFlow to finish this application.
It took some time to finish, and I learned a lot creating it.

# How can I use it?
Simple! Just run the program by either the python command line, python idle, or the executable you might find somewhere.
Then, simply type in the number of the mode you want, and then drag or copy the file path to the image you wish to convert.
Wait for the image to convert and that's it! Then, you can either pick to close the program or to continue working in it.
